# Python - Classes and Objects

## Project Overview
This project is part of the learning path focused on understanding **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** in Python, specifically through **Classes** and **Objects**. Throughout the project, you will learn how to define classes, create instances (objects), and explore class attributes, instance attributes, and methods.

The first task in this project is to create a simple, empty class `Square`, which will later be expanded to include more functionality. This is foundational for understanding how Python organizes data and behaviors into reusable and modular code using classes.

## Learning Objectives
By the end of this project, you will be able to:
- Understand the difference between a **class** and an **object**.
- Create a class and define attributes and methods.
- Utilize **instance attributes** and **class attributes**.
- Learn about **encapsulation**, and how to restrict access to certain attributes or methods.
- Understand how to initialize objects using the `__init__` method.

## Files in This Project

- `0-square.py`: Defines an empty class `Square`. This file will be expanded with more functionality in subsequent tasks.
- `0-main.py`: A test file that verifies the `Square` class has been defined correctly and can be instantiated.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- You need **Python 3.x** installed on your machine to run this project.

### Instructions to Run
