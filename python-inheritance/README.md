# Python Inheritance Project

## Overview

This project demonstrates how to use Python inheritance to create a custom class that extends Python's built-in `list` class. Specifically, the `MyList` class inherits from `list` and includes a custom method `print_sorted()` which prints the list in ascending order without modifying the original list.

## Files

- **my_list.py**: This file contains the `MyList` class definition, which extends the `list` class with an additional method `print_sorted()`.
- **1-main.py**: This script demonstrates how to use the `MyList` class, showcasing the `print_sorted()` method and ensuring that the original list is not modified.
- **tests/1-my_list.txt**: This is a doctest file containing test cases to verify that the `MyList` class and its `print_sorted()` method work correctly.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository and navigate to the project directory.
2. Ensure that the Python files are executable by running:

   ```bash
   chmod +x my_list.py 1-main.py
