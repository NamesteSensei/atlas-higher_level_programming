# Python Test-Driven Development

## 0. Integers Addition

This project implements a simple function `add_integer` that adds two integers or floats, casting them to integers if necessary. It raises an error if non-integer/float types are provided. The function is fully tested using doctests.

### How to Run the Tests

1. Ensure the files are saved and in the correct structure.
2. Run the following command to execute the tests:
   ```bash
   python3 -m doctest ./tests/0-add_integer.txt
