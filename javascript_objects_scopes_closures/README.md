# JavaScript - Objects, Scopes, and Closures

## Overview
This project focuses on using JavaScript to define classes, handle scopes, closures, and use object-oriented programming concepts. Each task builds on previous concepts and emphasizes best practices and proper coding style.

## Learning Objectives
- Understand class definitions in JavaScript
- Use `this` and object attributes effectively
- Manage closures and scopes
- Extend classes using inheritance
- Apply semistandard rules and clean code practices

## Requirements
- All files will be interpreted on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using Node.js version 14.x.
- Semistandard must be followed.
- All scripts must be executable and end with a newline.

## Tasks
### Task 0: Rectangle #0
Create an empty class `Rectangle` that defines a rectangle.
- File: `0-rectangle.js`.

### Task 1: Rectangle #1
Extend the `Rectangle` class to include `width` and `height` attributes.
- File: `1-rectangle.js`.

### Task 2: Rectangle #2
Ensure the rectangle class initializes properly and handles invalid inputs.
- File: `2-rectangle.js`.
