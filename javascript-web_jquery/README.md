# JavaScript Web JQuery

## Introduction
This project demonstrates the use of **JavaScript** and **JQuery** to manipulate the DOM, handle user events, and make API calls. The tasks cover essential JQuery operations, from selecting and modifying HTML elements to interacting with external APIs.

## Learning Objectives
At the end of this project, you will understand:
- Why JQuery simplifies front-end programming.
- How to select HTML elements in JavaScript and JQuery.
- The differences between ID, class, and tag name selectors.
- How to manipulate the DOM with JavaScript and JQuery.
- How to make GET and POST requests with JQuery Ajax.
- How to bind event listeners to DOM elements.
