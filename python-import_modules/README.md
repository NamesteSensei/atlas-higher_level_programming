# Python Module Import Example

This project demonstrates how to import a function from one Python file to another and execute it. The project consists of two files:

## Files

- **add_0.py**: Contains a simple `add` function that takes two integers as arguments and returns their sum.
- **0-add.py**: The main script that imports the `add` function from `add_0.py`, assigns values to variables `a` and `b`, and prints the result in a formatted string.

## How to Use

1. Make sure both `add_0.py` and `0-add.py` are in the same directory.
2. The `0-add.py` file is made executable, so you can run it directly from the command line:

   ```bash
   ./0-add.py
   ```

   Alternatively, you can run it using Python:

   ```bash
   python3 0-add.py
   ```

## Example Output

Running the script will produce the following output:
